Thank you for downloading my Castle Lib game!

This is my first ever attempt at a Unity Engine game, and was developed alongside my University course.

As such, there will be bugs and glitched that I have not discovered yet. If you find such a bug or glitch, please don't hesitate to contact
me at midgento@gmail.com

You can also send feedback to my itch.io page where you downloaded this from, where I will be continuing to work on this project
for as long as I can.
